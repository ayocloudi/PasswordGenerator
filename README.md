This Python script generates random passwords based on user-defined criteria such as the number of letters, symbols, and numbers desired in the password.

How it works:

The script prompts the user to input the desired number of letters, symbols, and numbers for the password.
It generates a password in two levels of complexity:

Easy Level: Characters are appended to the password sequentially, with letters, symbols, and numbers added in the order they are prompted.
Hard Level: Characters are randomized in the password, providing higher security.

The generated password is printed for the user.

Usage:

Run the script.
Input the desired number of letters, symbols, and numbers as prompted.
Receive a randomly generated password based on your input.

Example:

Easy Level: If you input 4 letters, 2 symbols, and 2 numbers, you might get a password like "JduE&!91".
Hard Level: For the same input, you might receive a password like "g^2jk8&P", where the order of characters is randomized.

Feel free to use and modify this script according to your needs!
